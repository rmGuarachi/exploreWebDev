# Explore Web Development - NYC SUBWAY MAP

I created this repository to learn web development. My goal for this project is to become familiar with the following libraries: sqlalchemy (python library), Tabulator.js, MapBoxGl JS, and Cytoscape.js. 


**NYC SUBWAY MAP** is a web application that will display NYC Subway information in a table, map, and display subway lines as graphs.

This web application, also contains the a MapBox tutorial page with examples pulled from the official MapBox Website and other resources.
