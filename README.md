# Explore Web Development - NYC SUBWAY MAP

I created this repository to learn web development. My goal for this project is to become familiar with the following libraries: sqlalchemy (python library), Tabulator.js, MapBoxGl JS, and Cytoscape.js. 


**Subway Map** is a web application that will display subway information in a table, map, and display subway lines as graphs.
